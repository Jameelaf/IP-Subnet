A Class C subnet is a range of IP addresses that fall within a specific IP address block and follow certain rules.

Understanding Class C Networks

IP Address Range for Class C:
Class C IP addresses range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
The first three octets are fixed, and the last octet can be assigned to hosts.

Default Subnet Mask for Class C:
The default subnet mask for a Class C network is 255.255.255.0 or /24 in CIDR notation.

In binary, it is represented as:
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
     The first 24 bits: network portion, and the last 8 bits (one octet): host portion

What is CIDR Notation?
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method for specifying IP addresses and their associated network prefix
CIDR notation represents an IP address along with the number of bits used for the network part of the address. 
     ----------- The format is: <IP address>/<prefix length>

Example of CIDR Notation
Consider the CIDR notation 192.168.1.0/24:
           - 192.168.1.0 is the base IP address.
           - /24 means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network part,leaving the remaining 8 bits for host addresses.

Subnet Characteristics:
- Network Portion: First three octets (e.g., 192.168.1)
- Host Portion: The last octet (e.g., .0 to .255)
- Number of Possible Hosts: In a Class C network, you can have 256 IP addresses (0 to 255). However, the 
        first address (.0) is reserved as the network address, and the last address (.255) is reserved as the broadcast address. 
        This leaves 254 usable IP addresses for devices (hosts).

Steps to Determine the Subnet of an IP Address:

    * Convert the IP Address to Binary
    
    * Convert the Subnet Mask to Binary

    * Determine Subnet Increment

    * Identify Subnet Ranges

1. Subnetting 192.168.1.1/26

Objective:
Learn how to answer an easy subnetting problem.

Purpose:
Learn how to apply the subnetting chart to an easy Class C subnetting problem.

Walkthrough:
Which subnet is host 192.168.1.1/26 in?

Step-by-Step Calculations:

IP Address in Binary: 192.168.1.1

192: 11000000, 168: 10101000, 1: 00000001, 1: 00000001

IP Address (binary): 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001

Subnet Mask in Binary: /26

255: 11111111, 255: 11111111, 255: 11111111, 192: 11000000

Convert Each Octet from Binary to Decimal:

Binary to Decimal Conversion Formula,
Value (b7 × 2^7) + (b6 × 2^6) + (b5 × 2^5) + (b4 × 2^4) + (b3 × 2^3) + (b2 × 2^2) + (b1 × 2^1) + (b0 × 2^0) 
  ----- (Where b0 to b7 are the binary digits (bits)). 

    
Determine Subnet Increment:

Notice the last octet (11000000), where the first two bits are 1s (26 bits in total) and the remaining 6 bits are 0s. 
These 0 bits determine the range of IP addresses in each subnet.

Subnet Increment Calculation:
The increment is 2^(number of 0 bits). Here, there are 6 bits, so 2^6 = 64. 
This means that each subnet will have a range of 64 IP addresses.

Identify Subnet Ranges:

To find the subnet ranges, we start from the base network address and increment by 64 until we reach the end of the address space (255).

Base Network Address: 192.168.1.0

SUBNET RANGES:

-----> 192.168.1.0 + 64 - 1 = 63, 192.168.1.63 

192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63 (First subnet)
192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127 (Second subnet)
192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191 (Third subnet)
192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255 (Fourth subnet)

Determine Which Subnet the Host is In:
The host IP address is 192.168.1.1. 
192.168.1.1 falls within the first subnet range 192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63

Conclusion:
Host 192.168.1.1 is in the 192.168.1.0/26 subnet.

NOTE:

The first address(of a subnet) is reserved for the network address.
The last address(of a subnet) is reserved for the broadcast address.

Example:

1. First Subnet (192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.63)
- Network Address: 192.168.1.0
- Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.63

2. Second Subnet (192.168.1.64 – 192.168.1.127)
- Network Address: 192.168.1.64
- Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.127

3. Third Subnet (192.168.1.128 – 192.168.1.191)
- Network Address: 192.168.1.128
- Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.191

4. Fourth Subnet (192.168.1.192 – 192.168.1.255)
- Network Address: 192.168.1.192
- Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255

Why Reserve These Addresses?

Network Address: Helps in organizing and managing networks effectively, enabling routers to identify and route traffic efficiently.

Broadcast Address: Facilitates efficient communication to all devices within a subnet without needing to address each device individually. 
This is especially helpful for protocols that require information to be broadcast to all network participants.
