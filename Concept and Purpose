IP Subnet: 
- A subnet (short for "subnetwork") is a smaller network created within a larger network to manage and organize IP addresses more efficiently. 
Subnets divide an IP address space into smaller, more manageable parts,making networking more scalable, secure, and efficient.

- When you subnet a network, you separate it into segments that each have their own range of IP addresses. 
   This is done by using a subnet mask to define which portion of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the 
hosts within that network.

Purpose of Subnetting:
- Efficient IP Address Management: Subnetting allows the use of smaller network ranges, which reduces the wastage of IP addresses. 
For example, instead of allocating a whole Class C network (192.168.1.0/24 with 256 IP addresses) to a small department with only 10 devices, 
you can allocate a smaller subnet (192.168.1.0/28 with 16 IP addresses).

- Improved Network Performance: By segmenting a large network into smaller subnets, you reduce broadcast traffic within each subnet. 
Each subnet has its own broadcast domain, minimizing network congestion and improving overall performance.

- Enhanced Security: Different departments or functions can be isolated on separate subnets. 
This can help in managing access control and monitoring traffic, providing an added layer of security.

- Simplified Network Management: Subnetting can make managing large networks easier. 
Networks are organized into smaller, more manageable subnets, making tasks like troubleshooting and policy implementation more straightforward.





Subnet Mask 
- It is a 32 bit number that divides the IP address into network and host portions. 

Structure: Consists of four octets separated by dots. 
     Example: 255.255.255.0 

In binary form, it is a sequence of 1s followed a 0s
           1 - denotes the network portion
           0 - determines the host portion
      Example: For an IP address 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0,
               Network Part: 192.168.1 (the first 24 bits are 1s)
               Host Part: 1 (the last 8 bits are 0s)
